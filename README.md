Minishell:

Redo bash but only implement some features such as :
  - Pipes (|)
  - Redirections and heredoc (<<, <, >, >>)
  - Builtins (echo, env, export, unset, cd, pwd)
  - Single and double quotes
  - Environment variables and exit code status ($?)
  - Signals (CTRL-D, CTRL-C, CTRL-\)



Hotfixes were done last minute, there might be issues related to that idk tho
